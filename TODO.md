# Opens Time Chat - Project To-Do List

## Phase 1: Testing & Daily Usage Exploration

### 1. Test Basic Functionality
- [ ] Test the `add` command to add context tags to current activities
  - [ ] Add tags for different project types (work, personal, learning)
  - [ ] Test with various categories (development, meetings, research)
  - [ ] Verify data is properly stored in ActivityWatch
- [ ] Test the `query` command to retrieve tagged activities
  - [ ] Query by date ranges
  - [ ] Query by specific tags
  - [ ] Query by categories
- [ ] Test the `search` command to find specific contexts
- [ ] Test the `summary` command for daily/weekly summaries
- [ ] Test the `enrich` command for batch processing historical data

### 2. Daily Usage Workflow
- [ ] Create a morning routine workflow
  - [ ] Plan the day's activities with pre-defined tags
  - [ ] Set up project contexts at the start of work sessions
- [ ] Develop context-switching patterns
  - [ ] Quick commands for switching between projects
  - [ ] Template for common activity types
- [ ] End-of-day review process
  - [ ] Generate daily summaries
  - [ ] Review untagged time periods
  - [ ] Plan next day based on insights

### 3. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with ActivityWatch MCP Server
  - [ ] Verify both tools can access the same data
  - [ ] Test querying tagged data through the MCP server
  - [ ] Ensure no conflicts between the tools

## Phase 2: MCP Server Development

### 1. Design MCP Interface
- [ ] Define MCP tools for the context tagger
  - [ ] `add-context` tool
  - [ ] `query-context` tool
  - [ ] `search-context` tool
  - [ ] `generate-summary` tool
  - [ ] `batch-enrich` tool
- [ ] Design response formats for each tool
- [ ] Plan error handling and validation

### 2. Implement MCP Server
- [ ] Set up TypeScript project structure
  - [ ] Copy boilerplate from activitywatch-mcp-server
  - [ ] Configure package.json and dependencies
- [ ] Implement core MCP functionality
  - [ ] Create Swift command execution wrapper
  - [ ] Handle async command execution
  - [ ] Parse Swift tool outputs
- [ ] Implement each MCP tool
  - [ ] Map MCP parameters to Swift CLI arguments
  - [ ] Handle response formatting
  - [ ] Add proper error handling

### 3. Combined MCP Configuration
- [ ] Design unified MCP server that combines both tools
  - [ ] Option 1: Proxy server that routes to both MCP servers
  - [ ] Option 2: Single server that includes both functionalities
  - [ ] Option 3: Keep separate but coordinate through shared config
- [ ] Create installation scripts
- [ ] Write configuration documentation

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features

### 1. Automation & Productivity
- [ ] Auto-tagging based on window titles
  - [ ] Create rules engine for automatic categorization
  - [ ] Machine learning integration for pattern recognition
- [ ] Project time budgeting
  - [ ] Set daily/weekly time goals per project
  - [ ] Real-time tracking against budgets
  - [ ] Alerts for time overruns
- [ ] Focus session tracking
  - [ ] Detect and tag deep work sessions
  - [ ] Track interruption patterns
  - [ ] Generate focus analytics

### 2. Reporting & Analytics
- [ ] Enhanced summary reports
  - [ ] Weekly/monthly rollups
  - [ ] Project time allocation charts
  - [ ] Productivity trends
- [ ] Export capabilities
  - [ ] CSV export for time tracking
  - [ ] JSON export for further analysis
  - [ ] Integration with time tracking services

### 3. AI-Powered Insights
- [ ] Daily AI analysis through MCP
  - [ ] Productivity pattern analysis
  - [ ] Suggestions for time optimization
  - [ ] Anomaly detection (unusual patterns)
- [ ] Natural language queries
  - [ ] "How much time did I spend on project X last week?"
  - [ ] "What were my most productive hours yesterday?"
  - [ ] "Show me my meeting vs coding time ratio"

## Phase 4: User Experience

### 1. Command Shortcuts
- [ ] Create shell aliases for common operations
- [ ] Implement quick-switch commands
- [ ] Add tab completion support

### 2. Configuration Management
- [ ] User preferences file
  - [ ] Default tags and categories
  - [ ] Preferred time formats
  - [ ] Report templates
- [ ] Project templates
  - [ ] Pre-defined tag sets per project
  - [ ] Activity type mappings

### 3. Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive user guide
- [ ] Create video tutorials
- [ ] Build example workflows
- [ ] FAQ section

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### 1. Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Unit tests for each command
  - [ ] Integration tests with ActivityWatch
  - [ ] MCP server tests
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add logging capabilities
- [ ] Performance optimization

### 2. Cross-Platform Support
- [ ] Test on Linux
- [ ] Test on Windows (if Swift is available)
- [ ] Docker containerization option

### 3. Security & Privacy
- [ ] Ensure local-only data storage
- [ ] Add data encryption options
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Privacy-focused reporting (no sensitive data in summaries)

## Next Session Priority

1. **Start with Phase 1.1**: Test all basic commands and verify they work correctly
2. **Move to Phase 1.2**: Develop a daily workflow that fits your routine
3. **Begin Phase 2.1**: Start designing the MCP interface

## Notes

- Consider keeping a journal of daily usage patterns to inform feature development
- Look for pain points in the current workflow that could be automated
- Think about how this tool could benefit other ActivityWatch users
- Consider open-sourcing the MCP server once it's stable
